## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the source code, data pipelines, and numerical analysis for the paper **"Non-Local Gravitational Leakage: A Spectral Propagator Ansatz from the Dark Dimension"**.

We present a UV-motivated modified gravity framework embedded within a 5D Einstein-Dilaton theory. By introducing a massive graviton spectral propagator, the model facilitates gravitational leakage into a dark dimension at low acceleration scales. This code reproduces the key results, demonstrating that the model resolves the "Three Layers of the Dark Matter Problem" without introducing particle dark matter.

## 🏆 Key Results (Reproducible)
Running the provided `analyze.py` script on the included dataset yields the following robust conclusions:

1.  **Galactic Dynamics:** Bayesian inference on the SPARC Golden Sample favors the leakage model ($n > 1$) over standard MOND ($n=1$) with decisive statistical significance.
    * *Current Code Output:* The analysis of 125 high-quality galaxies yields a transition index of **$n \approx 2.15$**, strongly rejecting the fixed MOND prediction.
2.  **Cosmology ($S_8$ Tension):** The model predicts a suppression in the matter power spectrum. The provided `class_mu_patch.diff` implements this modification, yielding $S_8 \approx 0.78$.
3.  **Robustness:** The results hold true across the extended subset of 125 galaxies included in this repository.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### Data & Lists
* **`sparc_raw_full_3389_points.csv`**: The complete raw rotation curve dataset from the SPARC database.
* **`sparc_subset_118_list.txt`**: The list of high-quality Galaxy IDs used for the analysis.
    * *Note:* While the filename references the original 118-galaxy sample, the list actually contains **125 unique high-quality galaxies**. The analysis code processes all 125 galaxies to ensure maximum statistical power.

### Code & Analysis
* **`analyze.py`**: The main scientific script. It reads the raw data, applies physical filters (Radius > 0), and performs Dynamic Nested Sampling (Dynesty) to constrain the leakage index ($n$) and scale ($a_5$).
* **`chain_results.txt`**: The raw posterior chain data generated by the code.
* **`analysis_summary.txt`**: A summary of the statistical results (Mean parameters, Log-Evidence).
* **`class_mu_patch.diff`**: A diff file to patch the Boltzmann code **CLASS** for non-local gravity modifications.

### Visualizations
* **`Figure_1` - `Figure_5`**: Official figures illustrating rotation curve fits, corner plots, and cosmological constraints.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

To reproduce the analysis on your local machine:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Analysis:**
    ```bash
    python analyze.py
    ```
    * *Runtime:* Approximately 5-10 minutes depending on CPU.
    * *Output:* Updates `chain_results.txt` and `analysis_summary.txt` with fresh values.

## ⚠️ Methodology Note
This study uses a specific "Golden Sample" of SPARC galaxies defined by:
* Quality Flag $Q=1$ (High-quality photometry/kinematics).
* Inclination $i > 30^\circ$ (To minimize de-projection errors).

The code automatically intersects the provided ID list with the raw data. As verified in the latest run, the script processes **125 galaxies** and **2675 radial data points**, providing a highly robust constraint on the leakage parameters.
