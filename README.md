## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the source code, data pipelines, and numerical analysis for the paper **"Non-Local Gravitational Leakage: A Spectral Propagator Ansatz from the Dark Dimension"**.

We present a UV-motivated modified gravity framework embedded within a 5D Einstein-Dilaton theory. By introducing a massive graviton spectral propagator, the model facilitates gravitational leakage into a dark dimension at low acceleration scales. This code reproduces the key results of the manuscript, demonstrating that the model resolves the "Three Layers of the Dark Matter Problem" without introducing particle dark matter.

### Key Results
1.  **Galactic Dynamics:** Bayesian inference on the SPARC Golden Sample (118 galaxies) favors the leakage model over MOND with high statistical significance ($Z \approx 3.81\sigma$).
2.  **Bullet Cluster:** WKB tunneling calculations explain the observed $\sim 200$ kpc offset between the gravitational center and X-ray gas, resolving a major challenge for non-local gravity theories.
3.  **Cosmology:** The model predicts a suppression in the matter power spectrum, yielding $S_8 \approx 0.78$, thereby alleviating the $S_8$ tension in modern cosmology.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### Data Files (Transparency & Source)
* **`sparc_raw_full_3389_points.csv`**: The complete raw rotation curve dataset for 175 galaxies from the SPARC database, containing 3389 individual radial data points. This is the **raw, unprocessed** input.
* **`sparc_subset_118_list.txt`**: The list of Galaxy IDs constituting the "Golden Sample" used for the primary analysis.
* **`chain_results.txt`**: The posterior chain data generated by the Dynamic Nested Sampling (Dynesty) run, used to provide the statistical basis for the results.
* **`analysis_summary.txt`**: A summary text file containing the final mean parameter values, errors, and Bayesian evidence scores.

### Analysis & Official Results
* **`analyze.py`**: The main scientific script. It reads the raw data, filters for the Golden Sample, and performs Bayesian parameter estimation to constrain the leakage index ($n$) and scale ($a_5$).
* **`Figures 1-5 (PNG)`**: Official visualizations presented in the manuscript. These figures are the static, verified results derived from the posterior distributions.
* **`class_mu_patch.diff`**: A diff file to patch the Boltzmann code `CLASS` for non-local gravity modifications (used for the cosmological $S_8$ analysis).

## ⚠️ Data Selection Methodology

To ensure robust physical constraints, this study analyzes a high-quality subset of the SPARC database, referred to as the **"Golden Sample"**.

While `sparc_raw_full_3389_points.csv` contains the full catalog, the analysis script (`analyze.py`) automatically filters galaxies based on the list in `sparc_subset_118_list.txt`. The selection criteria are:
1.  **Quality Flag ($Q=1$):** Only galaxies with high-quality photometry and kinematics are included.
2.  **Inclination ($i > 30^\circ$):** Galaxies with low inclination are excluded to minimize systematic errors arising from de-projection corrections ($1/\sin i$) and kinematic noise.

This filtering is standard practice in the literature to avoid contaminating the subtle gravitational leakage signature with observational artifacts present in low-quality or face-on systems.
